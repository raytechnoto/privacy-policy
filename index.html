                    <b> About this document </b> <br> Raytechnoto Labs considers user privacy of utmost importance and take all precautions
                    to protect user privacy during use of our android apps. This document details privacy policy for our android apps. 
                    Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What we don't collect</b> <br>We do not collect any personal information about the users of our apps. 
                    In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number or email address. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What we collect</b> <br>Like others, we anonymously collect some non-personal information via 3rd party 
                    technologies such as Google Analytics, Google Admob and Facebook Audience Network, who are governed by their
                    own privacy policies. We collect the data related to profiling of different parts of the application. Data 
                    collected is in aggregated form and analyzed as such. Also, we use anonymous identifiers when you interact 
                    with analytics and advertising services. As such, there’s no way Raytechnoto can map data collected to any
                    individual user or device. The kind of information collected includes, but is not limited to, type of device
                    or version of the OS you are using, general location data, app crash report, user sessions information and 
                    general pattern of app use. Also, we save your application data and preferences for personalization. This 
                    data is stored in your device’s internal storage. We do not have access to the same. As stated, we do not 
                    collect any personal information about the users of our apps and hence your non-personal data is truly 
                    anonymous.

                <p>

                    internal storage. We do not store any of your data on our servers. We take necessary actions, as 
                    standardized by android operating system, to protect data stored on your device from unauthorized access. 
                    Data and preferences stored on your device will be deleted upon uninstall of our app from your device. 
                    Non-personal information is collected via 3rd party analytics and advertising partners and is hosted on

                    not share, sell or rent it to any individuals or companies. We use information to get a better understanding
